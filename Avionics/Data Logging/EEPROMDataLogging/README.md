# LOGGING DATA FROM ESP32 USING AT24C256 I2C EEPROM

### This tutorial shows how to log sensor data from several sensors -MPU6050 and BMP 180- to an EEPROM module from an ESP32 module. 
### A setup guide for the sensors and EEPROM can be found on our blog https://nakujaproject.blogspot.com/2023/02/log-sensor-data-from-esp32-to-at24c256.html
